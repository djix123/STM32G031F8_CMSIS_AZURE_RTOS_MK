Example Project Showing CMSIS RTOS API layered over Azure RTOS (ThreadX) using x-cube-azrtos-g0
extension pack for STM32CubeMX
https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/x-cube-azrtos-g0

This project was originally based on the NUCLEO-G0B1RE/Applications/ThreadX/Tx_Thread_Creation example, before
adding the CMSIS RTOS API layer
(see https://github.com/djix123/STM32G031F8_AZURE_RTOS_MK for a version using ThreadX directly)

The current implementation of STM32CubeMX / x-cube-azrtos-g0 doesn't give the option to publish a
Makefile or Other type of project only the three IDES: IAR EWARM / Keil MDK-ARM / STM32CubeIDE

Fortuantely STM32CubeIDE is Eclipse/GNU based making translation to a Makefile project straightforward
